It's Minecraft... but the window shrinks every 60 seconds or so. (Customizeable within the program when you open it).

The "Requires AutoHotKey" version of the file is the raw code for this script, so feel free to inspect the code if you wish.

If you don't have AutoHotKey installed, run the compiled version.

I'm not gonna maintain this script or anything, but I did program it to work with any screen-size.

Only works on Windows w/ Minecraft Java Edition. Might not work with modified clients. (OptiFine works just fine, but clients that modify javaw.exe's name won't work)
